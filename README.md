## Guide

Hello, and thank you for showing interest in my RSS generator!

This generator is a standalone package that provides you with everything you need to create an RSS feed from a webpage that does not have one.

To do this it does two things:
  1. Periodically scans the webpage for updates & produces an xml file
  2. Hosts that xml file on a small, locally accessible server so that it can be read by an RSS feed reader

It should be noted that this means the generator will only work with Feed readers that are run from your machine and can access localhost. i.e. your feed reader has to be a standalone program or a browser add-on. Online feed readers are not compatible as they cannot read the xml file (unless you make a hole in your firewall and give the internet access to your computer).

A full list of compatible and incompatible readers can be found here.

To begin, download the program in one of three ways:
  1. Direct Download
  2. Torrent Download
  3. Clone this Git Repository

If you opt to clone the git repo, I apologize for the mess.

Once you have downloaded the .zip file, unzip it and you should have a folder with the following contents:
  - Feeds folder
  - Img folder
  - Pages folder
  - Feed_Definitions.txt
  - Generator.exe
  - Server.exe
